# Libft
My own Libft library (C programming)

This is a library with the some useful functions in C created by me. 

Those functions will help me with data treatement and it's the core of the project.

The guide to those functions is the 42 student project.

If you're a 42 student feel free to use my code as a guide to yours but never copy and paste.

G.T.A.
